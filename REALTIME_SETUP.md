# Real-Time Marketplace Updates

This implementation provides real-time updates to the marketplace when companies are approved, updated, or deleted in the database.

## How It Works

### Frontend Real-Time Subscription
The frontend uses Supabase's real-time features to listen for changes in the `companies` table:

1. **Connection Setup**: When the marketplace loads, it establishes a real-time subscription to the `companies` table
2. **Event Handling**: The subscription listens for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events
3. **Dynamic Updates**: When changes occur, the marketplace updates automatically without requiring a page refresh

### Event Types Handled

#### INSERT Events
- When a new company is added with `approved = true`
- Automatically adds the new company card to the marketplace
- Shows notification: "New company added!"

#### UPDATE Events
- **Approval**: When `approved` changes from `false` to `true`
  - Adds the company card to the marketplace
  - Shows notification: "Company approved!"
- **Unapproval**: When `approved` changes from `true` to `false`
  - Removes the company card from the marketplace
  - Shows notification: "Company unapproved!"
- **Other Updates**: When other fields are updated but `approved` remains `true`
  - Refreshes the entire list to ensure consistency
  - Shows notification: "Company updated!"

#### DELETE Events
- When a company is deleted from the database
- Removes the company card from the marketplace
- Shows notification: "Company deleted!"

### Connection Status
- **Connected**: Shows "Real-time updates connected!" when subscription is established
- **Error**: Shows "Connection error. Trying to reconnect..." if there's an error
- **Disconnected**: Shows "Connection lost. Reconnecting..." if connection is lost

## Testing the Real-Time Functionality

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure both frontend and backend are running:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the marketplace in your browser (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Company Approval**:
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard
   - Navigate to the `companies` table
   - Find a company with `approved = false`
   - Change `approved` to `true`
   - **Expected Result**: The company card should appear in the marketplace immediately with a "Company approved!" notification

2. **Test Company Unapproval**:
   - In Supabase, find a company with `approved = true`
   - Change `approved` to `false`
   - **Expected Result**: The company card should disappear from the marketplace with a "Company unapproved!" notification

3. **Test Company Update**:
   - In Supabase, update any field of an approved company (e.g., change the description)
   - **Expected Result**: The marketplace should refresh and show "Company updated!" notification

4. **Test New Company Addition**:
   - In Supabase, insert a new company record with `approved = true`
   - **Expected Result**: The new company card should appear immediately with a "New company added!" notification

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Files Modified
- `src/App.jsx`: Added real-time subscription logic and notification system
- `src/App.css`: Added notification animation styles

### Backend Files Modified
- `backend/server.js`: Added missing API endpoints for likes, views, bought counts, and comment deletion

### Key Features
- **Real-time Updates**: No page refresh needed
- **Visual Notifications**: Users see when changes occur
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection issues
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Attempts to reconnect if connection is lost

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No real-time updates**:
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Supabase real-time is enabled in your project
   - Ensure the frontend is connected to the correct Supabase project

2. **Connection errors**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify Supabase URL and API key are correct
   - Check if Supabase real-time service is available

3. **Notifications not showing**:
   - Check if there are any CSS conflicts
   - Verify the notification component is properly rendered

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking the browser console. The real-time subscription logs all events and connection status changes.
